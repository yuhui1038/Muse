The stories of the ancients, Leak through the cracks of time, In every leaf and shadow, A tale in rhythm and rhyme. The wind sings of the seasons, The changes we all face, But in this sacred moment, I feel the universe's grace. Take me back to simpler days, When laughter filled the light, In fields where dreams would dance, And the stars shone ever bright. With every step I'm taking, The past would guide my way, In the footprints left behind me, The echoes softly sway. I trace the paths forgotten, Through laughter, tears, and pain, In the hope that, just maybe, The light will shine again. The wind sings of the seasons, The changes we all face, But in this sacred moment, I feel the universe's grace. Take me back to simpler days, When laughter filled the light, In fields where dreams would dance, And the stars shone ever bright.

The love and pain entwined here, Like the branches overhead, The stories never-ending, In the dreams that I've been fed. Take me back to simpler days, When laughter filled the light, In fields where dreams would dance, And the stars shone ever bright. So here beneath the willow, I carve my dreams in stone, In whispers of the past, In memories I've known. Take me back to those days, When hearts would intertwine, And laughter filled the air, In moments pure and fine. Oh-oh, oh-oh. We'll find our way, in time. Oh-oh, oh-oh."}
